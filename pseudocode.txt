//pseudocode
- A function that divides a string into individual elements in an array "aabb" => ["a","a","b","b"]

function splitter (string)
//maybe a for loop?
//split at every character ==> split()
//push character into array
//return array of single characters

// - A function that determines if a given string is a palindrome
aha									2.5					2.5      5
bloolb  .reverse()?      0, str.length/2 ==>      str.length/2, str.length
gasag.length => odd or even

function isPalindrome (string)
//divide the string in two ==> slice()
//reverse one half somehow ==> split(). reverse()
//return whether they are even or not

// - A function that reverses a given string
//make it into array
//reverse the array
//stitch it back into a string


// - A function that capitalizes the first letter of every "word" in a string
// function take in a string
// split strings split(' ')
//lowercase each string .lowercase
//uppercase the first letter of string .chartAt(0) 
//lowercase remaining letters .substring



- A function that returns an object with a key for each letter in a string, and the quantity of that character as that key's value
//take in string
//cut up the string
//count each character and how many times a character occurs
//return the key and count



// - A function that console logs the numbers
//   from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print
//   "fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples
//   of five print "buzz". For numbers which are multiples
//   of both three and five print "fizzbuzz".


//function that counts-- while loop(countup= 0)
//console logs each number (countup++)
//if number is multiple of 3 console log "fizz" if if countup % 3 == 0 
//if number is multiple of 5 console log "buzz" if countup % 5 == 0 
//if number is multiple of both 3 and 5 "fizzbuzz"
