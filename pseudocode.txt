//pseudocode
- A function that divides a string into individual elements in an array "aabb" => ["a","a","b","b"]

function splitter (string)
//maybe a for loop?
//split at every character ==> split()
//push character into array
//return array of single characters

// - A function that determines if a given string is a palindrome
aha									2.5					2.5      5
bloolb  .reverse()?      0, str.length/2 ==>      str.length/2, str.length
gasag.length => odd or even

function isPalindrome (string)
//divide the string in two ==> slice()
//reverse one half somehow ==> split(). reverse()
//return whether they are even or not

// - A function that reverses a given string
//make it into array
//reverse the array
//stitch it back into a string


// - A function that capitalizes the first letter of every "word" in a dting


// - A function that returns an object with a key for each letter in a string,
//   and the quantity of that character as that key's value


// - A function that console logs the numbers
//   from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print
//   "fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples
//   of five print "buzz". For numbers which are multiples
//   of both three and five print "fizzbuzz".
