// ## Task
// Reinforce some higher level JS concepts, through the practice of pseudo code.
// ## Instructions
// - Create and link an HTML, CSS, and JS file
// - View and test this connection in the browser
// - Listed below will be several "Deliverables"
//   - With each deliverable, work out the "pseudocode" for each deliverable and write them out
//   - Once you and your partner feel you have worked out the logic in plain english, start to write out each
//     Deliverable as a function.
// ### Do's
// - Work out each deliverable with pseudocode FIRST
// - Use the debugger!
// - Look up ES6 syntax for functions
// - Google JS iterators and methods to help you! 
// ### Dont
// - Use a canned method without understanding what it does!
// - Code too much without testing
// - Solve the problem just ONE way, refactor!
// ## Deliverables
// - A function that divides a string into individual elements in an array "aabb" => ["a","a","b","b"]
// - A function that determines if a given string is a palindrome
// - A function that reverses a given string
// - A function that capitalizes the first letter of every "word" in a dting
// - A function that returns an object with a key for each letter in a string,
//   and the quantity of that character as that key's value
// - A function that console logs the numbers
//   from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print
//   "fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples
//   of five print "buzz". For numbers which are multiples
//   of both three and five print "fizzbuzz".
